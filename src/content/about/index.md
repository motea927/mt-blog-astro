Hello, I'm Morty.

I have a profound passion for computer science, with a particular interest in web development. Besides coding, I have been supplementing my knowledge through self-learning via platforms like YouTube, Udemy, and Medium.

I'm an avid contributor to open-source projects on GitHub. A noteworthy contribution of mine is to the GitLab CI documentation for pnpm, showcasing my technical ability and commitment to the open-source community.
